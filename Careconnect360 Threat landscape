- **Phishing Attacks**: Targeting users, including healthcare providers and patients, to steal login credentials.
- **Ransomware**: High risk as healthcare applications are prime targets due to the critical nature of the services they provide.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks**: Potential risk of data interception, particularly if network encryption is compromised.

### B. Internal Threats
- **Insider Threats**: Risk of misuse or leakage of sensitive patient information by employees or insiders with system access.
- **Human Error**: Potential for mismanagement of data, improper security settings handling, and errors in data entry leading to breaches or loss.

### C. Compliance and Regulatory Risks
- **Data Protection Non-Compliance**: Risks associated with failure to adhere to GDPR, HIPAA, or other regulations leading to legal and reputational damage.

## 2. Vulnerability Assessment
- **Software Vulnerabilities**: Necessity to audit and patch software components like React.js, Node.js, Apache, and MariaDB.
- **Encryption Gaps**: Full assessment needed to ensure complete encryption of data in transit and at rest.
- **Authentication Weaknesses**: Evaluation of the strength and implementation of JWT and two-factor authentication mechanisms.

## 3. Impact Analysis
- **Data Breach Impact**: Includes loss of patient trust, legal repercussions, and financial costs associated with fines and remediation.
- **Service Disruption**: Risk to patient health from delayed or unavailable critical healthcare services due to attacks.
